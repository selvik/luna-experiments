# This config creates a deployment with two pods, each requesting 100 millicores
# and trying to utilize slightly above 500 millicores (repeatedly using CPU for
# 0.5s and sleeping 0.5s).
# It also creates a corresponding Vertical Pod Autoscaler that adjusts the
# requests.
# Note that the update mode is left unset, so it defaults to "Auto" mode.
